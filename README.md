# 1--Simple-Interest-Rate-Plotter

## ℹ️ Overview
This project takes a principal amount and an interest rate, and will output the compounded value after a certain amount of years.

It includes a graphical representation of the compounding which demonstates the exponential nature of compound interest. It will also have a table for fast to find data.

## 🤩 Highlights 
- I have learnt how to use streamlit for a simple and user friendly interface.
- Learned to use basic python pandas and plotly for data and visulisation. (I would love to develop this more in my next project)
- I have learnt to add a requirements.txt to make it easier for people to use my code. I will continuously implement this in my future code via pip freeze.

## 😊 Author
I'm Vincent L, this is my first public project. I hope to build some more fun ones.
